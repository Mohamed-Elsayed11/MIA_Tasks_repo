# MIA_Tasks_repo

This repo is about MIA Training phase_1 Tasks,and in this repo i'm gonna describe each task.

## Task_1:

it is about c++ problem solving contests which is given in hackerrank, and it was about **5 problems**.  
[this is the contest Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/mia-robotics-task1)

<mark>And this is my score</mark>

## Task_2:

Task_2 is divided into problems:  

Problem 1:  
    1- it was about desing a full bridge rectifer that convert 220V(AC) to 5v(DC) and connect the 5V to a led and turn it off/on by a switching circuit.  
    2- it was about calculate the number of leds could be put in parallel by given the **total power and the maximum led cuurrend**.  
    
Problem 2:  
    Design a simple H bridge circuit to control the direction of the DC motor  

Problem 3:   
    this task is about identify the most suitable battery for a system cosist of **four 12V motors,each drawing 4A continuously,
    and a camera drawing 0.5A at 12V** and the system must operate for at least half an hour on a single charge.

## Task_3:

this task is also divded into problems but at the end it aim to form a complete robot that can do:  
1-Detecting Mines  
2-Defusing Mines  
3-Navigating the City  
4-Avoiding Obstacles  
5-Localization  

<mark>And this can be done by using some defined sensors and motors and MCU like:</mark>  

+ Arduino Uno
+ photoresistor
+ Buzzer
+ Servo motor
+ DC Motors
+ Ultrasonic Sensor

## Task_4:

**problem 1:**  
it is about deal with weather dataset and perform some opeations on it like:  
+ Clean and preprocess the data
    + handle missing values.
    + remove duplicates.
    + handle incorrect data.


+  Plot temperature over time.
+  Create a histogram of temperature distribution.
+  Plot a scatter plot of temperature vs. humidity.
+  Generate a correlation heatmap of the dataset and explain the output in a markdown cell.

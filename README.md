## Task_2:

Task_2 is divided into problems:  

Problem 1:  
    1- it was about desing a full bridge rectifer that convert 220V(AC) to 5v(DC) and connect the 5V to a led and turn it off/on by a switching circuit.  
    2- it was about calculate the number of leds could be put in parallel by given the **total power and the maximum led cuurrend**.  
    
Problem 2:  
    *Design a simple H bridge circuit to control the direction of the DC motor

# MIA_Tasks_repo

This repo is about MIA Training phase_1 Tasks,and in this repo i'm gonna describe each task.

## Task_1:

it is about c++ problem solving contests which is given in hackerrank, and it was about **5 problems**.  
[this is the contest Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/mia-robotics-task1)

<mark>And this is my score</mark>

## Task_2:

Task_2 is divided into problems:  

**Problem 1:**  

    1- it was about desing a full bridge rectifer that convert 220V(AC) to 5v(DC) and connect the 5V to a led and turn it off/on by a switching circuit.  
    2- it was about calculate the number of leds could be put in parallel by given the **total power and the maximum led cuurrend**.  
    
**Problem 2:**  

    Design a simple H bridge circuit to control the direction of the DC motor  

**Problem 3:**   

    this task is about identify the most suitable battery for a system cosist of **four 12V motors,each drawing 4A continuously,
    and a camera drawing 0.5A at 12V** and the system must operate for at least half an hour on a single charge.

## Task_3:

this task is also divded into problems but at the end it aim to form a complete robot that can do:  
1-Detecting Mines  
2-Defusing Mines  
3-Navigating the City  
4-Avoiding Obstacles  
5-Localization  

<mark>And this can be done by using some defined sensors and motors and MCU like:</mark>  

+ Arduino Uno
+ photoresistor
+ Buzzer
+ Servo motor
+ DC Motors
+ Ultrasonic Sensor

## Task_4:

**problem 1:**

it is about deal with weather dataset and perform some opeations on it like:  
+ Clean and preprocess the data
    + handle missing values.
    + remove duplicates.
    + handle incorrect data.


+  Plot temperature over time.
+  Create a histogram of temperature distribution.
+  Plot a scatter plot of temperature vs. humidity.
+  Generate a correlation heatmap of the dataset and explain the output in a markdown cell.

**problem 2:**

Creating a python chess game and creating its GUI by using **pygame**.

**problem 3:**

it is about creating a Machine Learning Model to make weather predication  by dealing with  **WeatherHistory Dataset**

## Task_5:

**problem:1**

it was apply a communication protocols between 3 MCUs one act as a master and one act as uart slave and last one act as i2c slave  and the two slaves
should communicates to each other across the master mcu without any direct connection between the two salves.

**problem:2**

it required to convert anlog signal to a digital one at differnet Sampling times and encoder bits.

## Task_6:

it is about design a H bridge circuit to control the speed and the direction ot DC Motor by using **Altuiom software**
